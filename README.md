## ðŸ”¶ Project Overview

This project involved creating a 2D animated scene in Adobe Animate, featuring a vintage black car moving across a stylized road. The purpose of this project was to implement core animation principles and explore the practical application of timeline-based animation in a professional software environment.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Techniques Used

- **Adobe Animate CC**: For designing and animating the scene  
- **Layers**: Each element (car body, wheels, road, background elements) was organized in individual layers to ensure better control and editing  
- **Motion Tweening**: Used for smooth movement of the car across the screen  
- **Frame-by-Frame Animation**: Subtle elements like wheel rotation and shadow movement  
- **FPS Settings**: 50 frames per second to ensure smooth animation  
- **Background Design**: Designed minimal elements like road, bushes, and clouds to maintain focus on the moving car

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Understanding the timeline and frame system in Adobe Animate  
- Applying the principles of motion and animation timing  
- Enhancing skills in layer management and symbol manipulation  
- Creating an illusion of motion using motion tweens  
- Practicing visual storytelling through minimalist animation

## âœ¨ Project Execution

1. **Scene Planning**: The scene was designed with a static background and a car meant to move from left to right.  
2. **Asset Creation**: The car was divided into symbols for body, wheels (front & back), bumper, and shadow.  
3. **Motion Application**: Applied tweens to simulate real car motion including tire rotation and shadow consistency.  
4. **Testing & Refinement**: The timeline was refined to make the motion natural and appealing.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with industry-standard animation software  
- Developed a better understanding of 2D animation workflows  
- Improved proficiency in motion tweening and object transformations  
- Learned how to structure animations for visual clarity and flow  

---

## ðŸ§© Challenges Faced

- Synchronizing the wheel motion to match the carâ€™s forward movement  
- Layer conflicts due to overlapping elements (solved by locking and organizing layers)  
- Maintaining consistent speed throughout the animation timeline  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

This project helped bridge the gap between theoretical animation concepts and practical application. It was a valuable learning experience in storytelling, design precision, and animation flow using Adobe Animate. I am now more confident in designing simple animations and plan to take on more complex projects in the future.
